**Next.js** is a React framework that enables several extra features, including **server-side rendering** and **static site generation**.

It helps developers build fast and SEO-friendly web applications by providing an optimized way to render pages.

Some key benefits of using Next.js include:

- Automatic page-based routing
- API routes built into the same project
- Image optimization
- Hybrid rendering support

If you are already familiar with **React**, learning Next.js will make it easier to handle rendering, routing, and deployment — all in one place.
